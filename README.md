Date First Uploaded: 12/14/21

##Project Overview
Gathered data from the archives of a Twitter account called WeRateDogs which rates owned dogs in their tweets and adds a humorous comment with it. Gathered retweet and like counts for all the tweets from the Twitter API using the access library tweepy and read them into a pandas dataframe in the Jupyter Notebook. Downloaded a tsv file about the tweets programmatically using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in python. Assessed quality and tidiness issues in the gathered datasets and cleaned all of them using pandas functions. Analyzed the cleaned tables and created visualizations using the matplotlib library.

##Packages
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, tweepy, json
